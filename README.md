# Idea of the Project
Our idea of the project is to have an intelligent and smart human-robot interaction, for passengers and tourists travelling from around the globe to Rome and reaching the Leonardo da Vinci International Airport, also known as Fiumicino Roma Airport using the Pepper robot. Through this project, Pepper has been programmed to perform various tasks to help passengers at the airport.

#  Aim/Purpose of the project
There are various scenarios considered in this project. There can be passengers departing the airport, passengers arriving at the airport and passengers who are in transit passenger travel category. We made a study which helped us to decide the list of major needs of passengers travelling through the airport from any of the passenger situations; departure or arrival or transit. The purpose of this project is to solve the passengers' query which may be faced during any of these situations.


# Brief summary of developments completed.
We have successfully tried to integrate QIBULLET[4], into the provided framework of Docker 0.4.1, and simulated the various tasks and joints movements. We have also completed various functionalities of each of the passenger travel categories:
- Departures: Customer Service, Lost and Found Office, Flight Information, Food Courts, Lounges, and lastly entertainment.
- Transit: Lost and Found Office, Flight Information, Lounges, Food Courts and Entertainment.
- Arrivals: Directions to Cab/ Taxi/ Bus, Trolley Location, Provision of Maps to shopping arena, Conveyor belts number.

We also added a database of flight information, which is used for checking the flight details for a passenger flight based on if they are just arriving or departing, this is to help Pepper answer their questions accurately. To achieve reading the database, we also have included the installation of the PANDAS library in our project. We are also able to play music, make pepper dance, show various locations in 3D format, and also perform MODIM operations using NAOQI commands.

# Motivation for this Project
As the whole world is busy fighting the consequences of the COVID-19, the number of travellers and tourists have reduced a lot. The major problem faced during this pandemic, is by staff, as well as passengers. Both passengers and staffs of the Airports/Airlines are faced with the challenge of not getting infected as they interact. To overcome this problem, we came up with a unique way of allowing Pepper assist to solve passengersâ€™ queries, which reduces the workload on airport staff as well as trying to keep the virus away from passengers and staff, by reducing human-human transmission.
Another problem which we have addressed in this project is the tiredness and stress a passenger feels as he keeps travelling from various places, time passenger travel categories and airports, and this can make such passenger stressed out and overwhelmed. Hence, we have also provided an entertainment section which can make the passenger to relax and also increase the metabolism in his body, making the passenger energetic and active.
